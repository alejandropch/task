# Task OpenLoop

For this project is not necessary to install the zip version on your computer, I already have deployed the project (the backend and the frontend) on some hosts providers.


- Frontend (Vercel): https://task-alejandro-alejandropch.vercel.app/
- Backend (Heroku): https://task-alejandro.herokuapp.com/
- Repository (GitHub): https://github.com/alejandropch/task-openloop

# Run the project 
Go to the client file, and in the command line execute...
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## Technologies

- I used the MERN stack for developing this web app.
- I choose Apollo for sending and receiving Queries and Mutations on GraphQL.
- This project has End-to-End testing with cypress, and you can try it out with the command.
```bash
npm run test  /* make sure you are on the client file */
```
✨ Happy hacking ✨
